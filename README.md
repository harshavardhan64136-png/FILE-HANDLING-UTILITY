*DESCRIPTION*:

##File handling is an important part of programming because most applications need to store and retrieve data from files. The Java program FileReadWriteModify.java demonstrates how to perform the three main types of file operations: writing to a file, reading a file, and modifying a file. It is written in simple, structured Java code and can be easily executed using the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE, which is a popular editor for developers working with Java.The program is divided into different utility methods, each responsible for one type of file operation. The writeFile() method is used to create a new file or overwrite an existing file with content. This is useful for saving initial data into a file. The readFile() method loads the file into memory and stores each line in a list, which allows the program to display and manipulate data line by line. To show the file contents, the printFile() method prints all lines to the console along with their index numbers.In addition to reading and writing, the program also demonstrates how to append new content to a file using the appendFile() method. This ensures that new lines are added at the end of the file without removing existing content. The modification part of the program includes three operations: replacing a line (replaceLine()), inserting a new line at a specific position (insertLine()), and deleting a line (deleteLine()). Each of these functions first reads the file into a list, makes changes in memory, and then writes the updated list back to the file.The main() method acts as a demonstration of these file operations. It first writes three lines into a file named demo.txt. Then it appends new lines, inserts a line at index 1, replaces the text at line 2, and deletes the line at index 3. After each operation, the program prints the fileâ€™s current state to the console so that the changes are clearly visible.Running this program in Visual Studio Code makes the process more user-friendly and efficient. VS Code provides tools such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection, which make it easier to write and debug Java programs. To use this program in VS Code, the Java JDK must be installed on your system, along with the Extension Pack for Java available in the VS Code marketplace. Once these are set up, you can create a project folder, add a file called FileReadWriteModify.java, and paste the code into it.VS Code provides an integrated terminal where you can compile the program using javac FileReadWriteModify.java and run it with java FileReadWriteModify. Alternatively, the IDE also allows you to run the program directly by pressing the Run button or using the shortcut Ctrl + F5. When the program runs, the terminal inside VS Code will display the output showing the file operations step by step. At the same time, the text file demo.txt will be created and updated in your project folder. You can open this file inside VS Code to verify the changes after each operation.In conclusion, this program provides a practical demonstration of file handling in Java, covering writing, reading, appending, and modifying text files. Using VS Code as the IDE enhances the experience by providing an easy-to-use environment with powerful developer tools. Together, the program and the IDE show how Java can efficiently manage file operations in real-world applications.
